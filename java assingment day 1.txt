   Assingment No. 1(Java programming zero to hero)             name:Shweta Jamdade.

Que. differance between compiler and interpreter.

Ans :
1. Compiler: 
-It is a translator which takes input i.e., High-Level Language, and produces an output of low-level language i.e. machine or assembly language. 
-A compiler is more intelligent than an assembler it checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors, etc.
But its program run time is more and occupies a larger part of memory. 
-It has slow speed because a compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes.


2.  Interpreter: 
-An interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. 
-It translates only one statement of the program at a time.
-Interpreters, more often than not are smaller than compilers.
